### Installation

To compile AES.py , we have to stall PyCrytodome.

For Linux, use the command "pip3 install -i https://pypi.douban.com/simple pycryptodome".

For Windows, use the command "pip3 install -i https://pypi.douban.com/simple pycryptodomex".

### Encryption & Decryption

To encrypt or decrypt anything, just add "from AES import encrypt , decrypt" to use.

encrypt(input) : the type of both input and output is string.

decrypt(input) : the type of both input and output is string.
